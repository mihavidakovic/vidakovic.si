			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>Hello! My name is Miha Vidakovič and I live in Kranj, Slovenia. I do freelance web and graphic design, lift weights, eat ice cream and burgers, and explore the outdoors. </p>

			<p>I specialize in creating websites that are user-friendly and built according to best-practice web standards. I also create corporate identity, branding, and other things. Over the past years, I've enjoyed working with wide array of clients which were pleased with my work.</p>

			<p>Design is my driving passion. Everything in my life is affected by it, life decisions are based upon it. Understanding how great design works - and showing others the importance of well thought out, beautiful design.</p>

			<h2>My process</h2>
			<p><b>1.</b> I sit down, open a Squared Moleskine and begin creating wireframing out the designs, giving solid thought to position, size and proportions. The next step is dig into Illustrator to finalise the wireframes to ensure a great user experience.</p>

			<p><b>2.</b> It’s Photoshop time! Taking the carefully crafted wireframes & userflows into consideration, I start to flesh out the user interface until I’m happy with it. Then it’s the time for little tweaks until the client is as well.</p>

			<p><b>3.</b> Here’s the really fun part. Taking those designs and using my frontend skills to make them awesome. Whether it be a quick static site, a content-managed site, or even an e-commerce store - it’s going to work extremely well.</p>
